# Why Do We Need ML in Science?
We have learned 

- Start by showing data: linear
- Try to fit it: how would you do? draw a line/curve? 
- Chi square fit: minimisation of chi square sum: trivial, evident logic
- What about this data?
- Even more complex data? Surely we can use a similar method for multidimensional setup, bu are you really going to test all the functions you know that look like fitting to the data distribution? How would you fit multivariate complex problems?
  - How would you find the optimal route on a map where roads may not be linear
  - How would you simulate the evolution of cells 
  - How would you tell what particle was that in a given event from gigantic particle detectors where they may generate more than one petabyte of data per second
  - think about other examples where ML is already irreplaceable
- The idea of using ML is to build a model that is capable of capturing complex pattern under the hood
- Now, the model is...
  - not expressed in analytic parameters as in coefficients or exponents of an equation
  - expressed in numerical parameters which are structured in some structure/shape called a model
  - together with the values of parameters and the structure they are memoriesed plays a role as a 'fit' as the linear function we first saw
  - So they are not comprehensible by being visually investigated
  - Yet we can understand what is the governing logic of the building blocks and the structures of the models
