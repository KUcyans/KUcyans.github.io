Perhaps you may know that feeling of being in the zone, full of inspiration, and completely absorbed in your code, if you’re anything like me. But soon after you find your script has gotten so hairy, not necessarily buggy though. Have you ever thought in such a situation, this can't be the most optimal way to do it,recalling there are millons of programmers better than I on this planet? Perhaps your code is already excellent, but it seems there always is a room for code refactoring. Code with a robust structure can bring you huge advantages: ease of maintaining and expansion of your code base without repeated headache-causing copy-pasting. 

# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-oriented programming is a philosopy of programming focusing on encapsulation and modularity of code with introduction of objects. Objects are a set of data that contains data and functions. Objects play a role as the unit building block of many object-oriented paradigms. In object-oriented programming languages, classes are used to create objects. 

The behaviour and structure of classes are guided by three central ideas: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

Encapsulation is the concept of placing related data and functions together inside a single class. This makes the bundle, the class, act as a coherent module in your code, protecting its objects from unintended access from outside the bundle. Inheritance allows a class to reuse and extend the code of another class. It forms a hierarchical structure where specific classes are built from more general ones.

Polymorphism allows objects created from related classes to be treated through a common interface while behaving differently depending on their specific class. This makes class-based implementations more flexible and adaptable.

# So, how to Practive Objective-Oriented Programming?
It may sound absurd, but there is no exact way to practice OOP in every situation, since the best approach always depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve. Yet, we have what's called design pattern, which are solutions for commonly known software design problems. When used in the right context, design patterns can make your code more robust, reusable, and easier to maintain. The individual design patterns are well explained in [Refactoring Guru's webpage](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). 



Perhaps you're already reduced enough, but in my experience, there has always been more space for improvement when it comes to code refactorisation.

Objective-oriented programming is particularly beneficial for tools that need to extend their functionalities. Consider this example,
