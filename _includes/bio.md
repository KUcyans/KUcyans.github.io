Hello! I’m Cyan, a computational physicist specialising in neutrino event reconstruction,
machine learning, and high performance computing.

My latest research focuses on transformer-based models for high-energy neutrino flavour
classification, focusing on IceCube neutrino event data. I have experimented with different
architectural hyperparameters and their contribution to the final performance. I am certain
there is plenty of room for further experiments.

I'm currently bringing this to a different context, assuming transformers can be a nice
building block for a tiny regional weather forecast model.

### My interests include:
- Applying machine learning to scientific problems  
- Hardware optimisation for computation  
- Data pipeline design and implementation  
- Statistical representation of data  
- High-energy (astro)particle physics  

### In this site you’ll find:
- My points of view on ML and its application  
- Notes on physics, ML, and experiments  
- Personal thoughts and research reflections
